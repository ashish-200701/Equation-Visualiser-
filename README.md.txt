This is Simple Python Equation Visualiser which helps users to plot mathematical equations by entering in the form of y = f(x). The main idea was to create a small visualizer which helps us to understand how different equations behave when they are plotted in a graph.
This Tool can help users plot normal algebraic expressions, trigonometric functions, polynomial equations and several basic math operations.

This tool uses Tkinter For the user interface and matplotlib for drawing the graph.


Features of this tool
1.Plots linear equation like 2x + 3
2.Plots quadratic equation like x^2 + 5x - 2
3.Plots trigonometric functions like sin(x), cos(x), tan(x)
4.It Also Supports Exponential and logarithmic functions.
5.It also has the option to adjust the graph range and smoothness(samples)
