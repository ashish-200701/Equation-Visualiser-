# Problem Statement
The Main Objective Of creating this tool is to plot mathematical Equations in the form of y = f(x)
Many Students Find it very difficult to figure out hoe different equations look when they are plotted in a grpaph.

This tool helps them visualise equations easily.The idea is to make a small equation visualiser that works for common maths functions like algebraic, polynomial and trignometric equations.

# Scope of the project
## The project focuses on plotting graphs for:
- Linear equations
- Quadratic equations
- Polynomial expressions
- Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan)
- Exponential and logarithmic functions


The scope is limited to single-variable equations in terms of x.


The tool also allows changing the graph range and number of samples to control smoothness.


## Target Users
- Students learning maths and graphing
- Anyone who wants to quickly check how an equation looks
- Beginners trying to understand functions visually
- People who want a simple desktop tool to test basic equations

# High-Level Features
- Plots equations written in normal mathematical form
- Supports trigonometric operations in degrees
- Fixes expressions like 2x into valid Python (2*x)
- Adjustable range and smoothness (samples)
- Clean and simple interface using Tkinter
- Graph drawn using Matplotlib
